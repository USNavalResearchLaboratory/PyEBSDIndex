===================================
PyEBSDIndex |release| documentation
===================================

Python based tool for Hough/Radon based EBSD orientation indexing.

The pattern processing is based on a GPU pipeline, and is based on the work of S. I.
Wright and B. L. Adams. Metallurgical Transactions A-Physical Metallurgy and Materials
Science, 23(3):759–767, 1992, and N. C. Krieger Lassen. Automated Determination of
Crystal Orientations from Electron Backscattering Patterns. PhD thesis, The Technical
University of Denmark, 1994.

The band indexing is achieved through triplet voting using the methods outlined by A.
Morawiec. Acta Crystallographica Section A Foundations and Advances, 76(6):719–734,
2020.

Additionally NLPAR pattern processing is included (original distribution
`NLPAR <https://github.com/USNavalResearchLaboratory/NLPAR>`_); P. T. Brewick, S. I.
Wright, and D. J. Rowenhorst. Ultramicroscopy, 200:50–61, May 2019.).
