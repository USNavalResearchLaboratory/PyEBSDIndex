    "### Loading data from an HDF5 File\n",
    "There is some limited support for specific types of HDF5 files using the _\"filename\"_ keyword to `index_pats` or `index_pats_distributed`.  However, probably the easiest method is to just point a h5py Dataset at the `patsin` keyword (This makes the important assumption that the patterns are stored in `[npatterns, nrows, ncols]` and the first point stored is the upper left corner of the detector).  See below: "
